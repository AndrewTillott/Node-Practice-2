# Node-Practice-2
Refamiliarising myself with Node through a tutorial. 

The code for this is not designed to be optimised or efficient (it is essentially just my notes from following the tutorial).

I found watching his previous node tutorial to be really interesting and useful despite working with node previously: so I decided to go through his second one too.

-What is node.js?

We typically think of code as front end and back end. 

The front end is typically what happens in the browser. 

Node allows us to use code on the server.

-Code

We have machine code which computers can understand. 

This is converted to assembly language. 

This can then be converted to C++ 

Javascript can be run in the browser thanks to the v8 engine (which compiles javascript into machine code)

-Node Allows

: read and write files on a computer 
: connect to a database 
: act as a server for content
